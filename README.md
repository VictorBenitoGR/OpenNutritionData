The intelligent collection, cleaning, processing and visualization of data is an indispensable process for the efficient, precise, productive and sharp **self-criticism** of any project. 

This project seeks to make supply chains in the grocery sector more efficient, secure and customizable, addressing problems of logistics, shrinkage reduction and segmentation at the local, regional or national level of consumption.

## Background
This project started as a personal initiative during my university career at Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM), who has agreements with several companies to facilitate students the development of projects attacking the specific problems they have (in this case Iconn Group of 7-Eleven). this collaboration happened in two subjects under different approaches, in both I managed to reach the regional and national phases.


## Current development
